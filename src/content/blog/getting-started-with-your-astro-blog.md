Here are a few things you might want to do next:

1.  **Customize your site**: 
    *   Edit `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to change the overall page structure.
    *   Modify `src/pages/index.astro` for your homepage content.
    *   Update `astro.config.mjs` for site-wide configurations, like your site URL.

2.  **Add Integrations**:
    *   Astro has many integrations for things like Tailwind CSS, React, Svelte, MDX, and more.
    *   Check the [Astro Integrations Directory](https://astro.build/integrations/).
    *   Example: To add Tailwind, run `npx astro add tailwind` and follow the prompts.

3.  **Create more content**: 
    *   Add new Markdown (`.md`) or Astro (`.astro`) files to `src/content/blog/`.
    *   Make sure to include frontmatter like `title`, `pubDate`, and `layout`.

4.  **Explore Astro features**: 
    *   Check out the official [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).
    *   Learn about routing, components, layouts, and content collections.

Enjoy your new blog!
